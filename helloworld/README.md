# Overview

As a software engineer, I am focused on mastering the foundational building blocks of programming. This initial project involves creating a simple command-line application to ensure my development environment is configured correctly and to practice the fundamental syntax of compiling and executing a C++ program.

The software is a console application that, when run, displays the classic message "Hello World!" to the screen.

The purpose of this software is to verify my C++ development and execution environment and to demonstrate a core understanding of how to produce output in a program. This is a traditional first step in learning any new programming language.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my primary text editor for writing the source code. To compile the code into a runnable program, I used the g++ compiler which is part of the MinGW-w64 toolchain. This setup allows me to compile and run the C++ application directly from the integrated terminal.

The programming language used for this project was C++.
